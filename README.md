# car_model_wordlist

A wordlist that contains car manufacturers and some of their models in a convenient .txt format

Thanks to matthlavacka on Github for their repository (https://github.com/matthlavacka/car-list/blob/master/car-list.json), which I converted into a .txt file so that it is easier to use in dictionary attacks.
